# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Performance Analysis

This project analyzes U.S. domestic flight data (5.8M+ records) to compare airline performance, operational efficiency, and route-level reliability. It includes both descriptive analytics and a predictive delay model.

## üîç Objective

- Compare U.S. airlines by average delays, cancellations, and distance
- Identify time-based and airport-specific patterns
- Build a Random Forest model to predict if a flight will be delayed >15 minutes

## üìä Key Insights

- **Best Airlines**: Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines had the lowest arrival delays.
- **Best Time to Fly**: Flights departing between 5‚Äì8 AM had the least delays.
- **Worst Airports**: JFK and LaGuardia showed highest taxi-out times; Wilmington & Trenton had worst delay rates.
- **Main Causes of Delay**: Late aircraft and airline-related factors were dominant.
- **Modeling**: Random Forest achieved 78% accuracy but struggled with class imbalance.
